# Data Structures using python

- Linkedlist using python
    - Insert an element at the end 
    - Insert an element in the begining
    - Insert an element before an element
    - Insert an element after an element
    - Delete an element in the begining
    - Delete an element from the end
    - Delete an element from middle
    - Reverse Single Linekdlist

- Doubly linkedlist using python
    - Insert an element at the end
    - Insert at the begining of the linkedlist
    - Printing reverse linkedlist
    - Reversing the linkedlist using doubly linkedlist
    - Delete element from middle


- Practice Questions
    - Given two Linked Lists, create union lists that contain union of the elements present in the given lists. Order of elments in output lists doesn’t matter.
